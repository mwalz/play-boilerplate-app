Securable Play 2.0.4 Application
================================

While building some Play authenticated applications, we took in all the examples and shared knowledge available in the Play documentation, Github, Stackoverflow, blogs etc. We learned there are several ways to address authentication in Play. Aside from the built in security options, [Deadbolt 2](https://github.com/schaloner/deadbolt-2) is very nice, as is [Secure Social](http://securesocial.ws). 

[Julien Richard-Foy's](https://github.com/julienrf) Stackoverflow answers ([1](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10215169/in-play-2-0-with-security-trait-how-do-i-redirect-to-the-original-url-after-log/10224950#10224950), [2](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9629250/how-to-avoid-passing-parameters-everywhere-in-play2/9632085#9632085)) are incredibly insightful.

[Brian Smith's](https://github.com/bmjsmith) [Gist](https://gist.github.com/3160915) and Stackoverflow [answer](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11639347/play-framework-2-scala-templates-see-if-user-is-logged-in/11639463#11639463) were a huge help. 

This is only a sample project, designed to share some of what I learned while building some internal applications. It was created as an example of a simple rights/admin app with the most current versions of Play, Bootstrap and Jquery. It is a reference as we create internal tools.
